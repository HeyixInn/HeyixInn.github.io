<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yixin He, a second-year Master's student in Computer Science (CSAI) at USC ðŸŽ“. I'm currently working remotely as a Research Assistant with Dr. Simin Chen and Prof. Baishakhi Ray from Columbia University. This year, I'm applying to Ph.D. programs to further pursue my research passion âœ¨.
My interests include:

LLMs for Code: Exploring how to improve the code generation, bug fixing, and security capabilities of large language models. This includes enhancing code quality, automating debugging, and studying adversarial attacks and defenses in code-based systems.

LLM Reasoning: Enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by improving their accuracy, consistency, and efficiency. I am especially interested in techniques that enable models to reason with fewer tokens, reduced latency, and stronger logical coherence.

I'm always excited about discussions and collaborations! Feel free to reach out via email if you're interested in my work or just want to chat about research ideas ðŸ’¬.
