<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi! 👋 I'm Yixin He, a second-year Master's student in Computer Science (CSAI) at USC 🎓. I'm currently working remotely as a Research Assistant with Dr. Simin Chen and Prof. Baishakhi Ray from Columbia University. This year, I'm applying to Ph.D. programs to further pursue my research passion ✨.
My interests include:

- **🔧 LLMs for Code**: Investigating how to advance the capabilities of large language models in code generation, automated program repair, and software security. I’m particularly interested in methods that improve code reliability and maintainability, as well as techniques for modeling and mitigating adversarial behaviors in LLM-powered code systems.

- **🧠 LLM Reasoning**: Aiming to enhance the reasoning efficiency and fidelity of LLMs by developing approaches that reduce computational overhead while preserving or improving logical consistency and correctness. My focus lies in enabling LLMs to reason more accurately, coherently, and efficiently under constrained inference settings.

I'm always excited about discussions and collaborations! Feel free to reach out via email if you're interested in my work or just want to chat about research ideas 💬.
